# Software I project for WGU

The goal of the project was to create an inventory management system for a company that uses parts to create products.
Some parts are produced in-house, while others are outsourced. Therefore, the "part" class is abstract, while in-house and outsourced are the two possible concrete subclasses.
Each product has a list of parts that comprise that product.
